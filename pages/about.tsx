          <p>
            ODFM (Open Doors for Maui) is a community maintained directory where
            anyone affected by the Maui wildfires can easily share their
            information discretely to be matched with available housing or
            supplies.
          </p>
          <p>
            It serves as an open and free platform for community organizations
            to streamline their recovery effort by directing their inquiries to
            ODFM they can then easily manage and track requests from a secure
            and easy to use dashboard.
