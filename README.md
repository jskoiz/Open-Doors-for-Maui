# Open Doors for Maui

The website is built using [Firebase](https://console.firebase.google.com/), [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and deployed at [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

## Development

The code was forked from [Hawaiians in Tech](https://hawaiiansintech.org/). The following instructions should help you running on your local machine to get started.

### Install the dependencies

Making sure you're in the correct project folder and install the dependencies:

```
yarn install
```

### Run the project locally

In your browser, open `localhost:3000`.

You can also load mock data in `index.tsx` by updating the import statement to `"@/lib/stubApi"`

import {
  Focus,
  getFocuses,
  getIndustries,
  getMembers,
  Industry,
  MemberPublic,
} from "@/lib/api";
/* ðŸ”ºðŸ”ºðŸ”ºðŸ”ºðŸ”ºðŸ”ºðŸ”º */
```
